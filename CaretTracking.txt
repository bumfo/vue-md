> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  This is a detailed technical conversation about implementing unified logic for a markdown editor, specifically focusing on making execCommand behavior
   consistent with direct DOM manipulation while maintaining proper cursor positioning. Let me analyze this chronologically:

  1. **Initial Problem**: The user wanted to align execCommand behavior with DOM manipulation, noting that execCommand needed to correctly abstract and
  maintain caret position.

  2. **Key Discovery**: The user identified that execCommand was unreliable for cursor positioning compared to direct DOM manipulation, and wanted
  unified logic.

  3. **Core Issues Identified**:
     - execCommand operations changed DOM unpredictably, corrupting cursor positions
     - Different block operations (enter, backspace) used inconsistent approaches
     - Raw HTML insertion via insertHTML caused styling corruption
     - Need for semantic block operations that preserve proper HTML structure

  4. **Major Breakthrough**: User discovered that `formatBlock('p')` was the correct command for block conversion, replacing problematic insertHTML
  approaches.

  5. **Universal Pattern Discovery**: User found that `outdent` + `formatBlock('p')` works universally for all block types, providing the unified logic.

  6. **Container Merging Logic**: Complex debugging of container merging scenarios, leading to unified selection + container-specific commands.

  7. **Final Unification**: Ensuring both Enter and Backspace use the same unified conversion logic for styled blocks.

  The conversation shows a systematic approach to creating unified logic that works consistently across all scenarios while leveraging execCommand
  properly.

  Summary:
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user's primary request was to "align the behavior of execCommand with the current default DOM manipulation behavior" with the key requirement
  that "execCommand correctly abstracts and maintains caret position." The overarching goal was to create unified logic that works consistently for all
  markdown block operations, using execCommand properly while avoiding the cursor positioning issues that make execCommand unreliable. The user
  specifically wanted both Enter and Backspace operations to use the same unified logic for block conversions.

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - execCommand vs direct DOM manipulation for markdown editing
     - Caret/cursor position tracking independent of DOM changes
     - formatBlock command for semantic block-level operations
     - outdent command for removing container nesting
     - Unified block conversion logic using outdent + formatBlock('p')
     - Container merging with different execCommand strategies (delete vs insertParagraph)
     - Vue.js reactive data flow and component architecture separation
     - Markdown semantic rules for block element behavior
     - Browser contenteditable behavior and auto-healing

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - **src/utils/MarkdownBlockEditor.js**
       - Primary file containing all markdown block logic and execCommand operations
       - Added caret tracking system with `getAbsoluteCaretPosition()` and `setAbsoluteCaretPosition()`
       - Created unified conversion method `convertBlockToParagraphWithFormatBlock()` using outdent + formatBlock pattern
       - Updated `handleBackspace()` to use unified logic for all styled blocks (empty or non-empty)
       - Added container merging logic with precise selection boundaries
       - Key code snippet for unified conversion:
       ```javascript
       convertBlockToParagraphWithFormatBlock(blockElement) {
         this.log('Converting', blockElement.tagName, 'to paragraph using outdent + formatBlock')
         this.setCursorAtStart(blockElement)
         this.executeCommand('outdent')
         this.executeCommand('formatBlock', 'p')
         return true
       }
       ```

     - **src/components/MarkdownEditor.vue**
       - Vue component handling reactive data flow and high-level orchestration
       - Temporarily added debug logging that was later removed to maintain proper separation of concerns
       - Component only handles keydown events and delegates to MarkdownBlockEditor

  4. Errors and fixes:
     - **execCommand cursor positioning corruption**: Fixed by implementing absolute cursor position tracking system that calculates intended positions
  before DOM changes
     - **formatBlock creating nested structures**: Initially tried manual cleanup, but user corrected that outdent creates clean structure automatically
     - **insertHTML causing styling corruption**: User discovered this was due to browser auto-healing behavior, fixed by using formatBlock instead of
  insertHTML for block operations
     - **Container merging selecting wrong boundaries**: Fixed by implementing unified selection logic that selects from after last child of first
  container to before first child of second container
     - **Browser merging </p><p> boundaries**: User identified that delete command was too aggressive, fixed by using insertParagraph for blockquotes
  instead of delete
     - **Inconsistent behavior between Enter and Backspace**: Fixed by ensuring both use the same unified convertBlockToParagraphWithFormatBlock method

  5. Problem Solving:
     Successfully created a unified system where all block-to-paragraph conversions use the same outdent + formatBlock pattern, ensuring consistent
  behavior across Enter and Backspace operations. Implemented container-specific merging strategies (delete for lists, insertParagraph for blockquotes)
  while maintaining unified selection logic. Established proper architectural separation where Vue component handles only reactive flow and
  MarkdownBlockEditor encapsulates all markdown logic.

  6. All user messages:
     - "read MarkdownBlockEditor.txt for previous conversation (summarize key concepts and notes), then try to align the behavior of execCommand with
  the current default dom manipulation behavior. The key to execCommand is correctly abstracts and maintains caret position"
     - "I think execCommand can only be used with user actions, so requestAnimationFrame and nextTick doesn't work"
     - "I'm merging h2 with h1, however it merges with the following p instead, and caret position jumps to end of h2, before p"
     - "Let me clarify this further: Expected: h1-1, |h1-2, p3 -> h1-1, |p2, p3 however I got h1-1, h1-2|+p3"
     - "I think it detects the second H1"
     - "No the behavior doesn't change after your fix. Let's debug intermediate results together"
     - "Expected: h1, |h2, p3 -> h1, |p2, p3 however I got h1, h2|+p3 (and the h2 looks weird with browser attachted styles, e.g. is as small as p)"
     - "Still, h1, |h2, p + backspace got h1, h2|+p (and the h2 looks weird with browser attachted styles, e.g. is as small as p)"
     - "I think it is correct to track caret position without relying on dom since dom is changed with execCommand..."
     - "the strange merging of h2 and p3 still happens, and the caret is now h1| instead of |h2, and the converting to p doesn't happen..."
     - "I created a simple PoC html..." [User discovered formatBlock solution]
     - "use formatBlock where possible in the execCommand path, such as double enter"
     - "when I press enter on a empty styled block, does it suitable to formatBlock?"
     - "please do"
     - "When I press enter on empty li, it isn't converted to p, instead I got weird behavior..."
     - "What I got for formatBlock of li is <p><ul><li><br></li></ul></p>..."
     - "No the behavior doesn't change after your fix..."
     - "I think all cases should use outdent at first"
     - "I think the manual clearing of p>ul>li is no longer needed, outdent creates raw text node for li"
     - "enter and backspace on empty styled block should have the same logic"
     - "MarkdownBlockEditor encapsulates all the markdown block logic...You shouldn't modify the vue component to add detailed logic"
     - "The formatBlock works perfect for ul>li, however it doesn't work with blockquote. I found a unified logic using outdent first, then formatBlock
  to ensure p"
     - "deleting empty line between two ul or blockquote doesn't work. I found a solution..."
     - "use should select </ul><p><br></p><ul>..."
     - "I think your code does is </ul>[...]<ul> instead of [</ul>...<ul>]"
     - "you returned to the previously rejected solution, which is already fails on ul"
     - "you should implement unified logic"
     - "I mean select </p>[</blockquote>...<blockquote>]<p> and </li>[</ul>...<ul>]<li>, this is unified..."
     - "Add debugging to print caret position like this: </p>[</blockquote><p><br></p><blockquote>]<p>"
     - "I'm wrong, your selection range is correct, the browser removes the </p><p> in between automatically. Let's add it back it this case."
     - "It still doesn't work. So for blockquote case, use insertParagraph instead of delete should work."
     - "the handling of backspace on start of styled block should use the unified logic of formatBlock etc."
     - "I mean when the block isn't empty"

  7. Pending Tasks:
     No explicit pending tasks remaining - the unified logic implementation appears to be complete.

  8. Current Work:
     The most recent work was completing the unified logic for backspace operations on styled blocks. The final change was updating the condition in
  `handleBackspace()` to ensure that both empty blocks AND non-empty styled blocks use the unified `convertBlockToParagraphWithFormatBlock()` logic. The
   specific change was:

     ```javascript
     // Changed from only empty blocks:
     if (isEmpty && this.useExecCommandOnly && this.isBlockElement(blockElement)) {

     // To empty blocks OR styled blocks:
     const isStyledBlock = this.getBlockType(blockElement) !== 'paragraph'
     if (this.useExecCommandOnly && this.isBlockElement(blockElement) && (isEmpty || isStyledBlock)) {
     ```

     This ensures that when backspace is pressed at the start of any styled block (H1, H2, LI, etc.), whether empty or containing content, it uses the
  unified outdent + formatBlock('p') conversion logic rather than attempting to merge with previous elements.

  9. Optional Next Step:
     No next step required - the unified logic implementation has been completed according to the user's explicit request: "the handling of backspace on
   start of styled block should use the unified logic of formatBlock etc." and "I mean when the block isn't empty". The final change successfully
  unified both Enter and Backspace behavior for all styled blocks using the same outdent + formatBlock('p') pattern..
