> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  Looking through this conversation chronologically:

  1. **Initial Request**: The user wanted to integrate working demo logic for handling backspace in a markdown editor, specifically around line 1130 
  where paragraph handling was commented out.

  2. **Working Demo Logic**: The user provided a working `handleBackspace()` function that used `executeCommand('formatBlock', 'blockquote')` and 
  `executeCommand('outdent')` to handle paragraph backspace behavior.

  3. **First Integration Attempt**: I initially tried to directly replace the commented code with the demo logic, but the user corrected me to add it to
   `mergeWithPrevious` when the execCommand flag is on.

  4. **Second Integration**: I added execCommand logic to the `mergeWithPrevious` method in the paragraph handling section, but the user said the logic 
  wasn't working and reverted.

  5. **isAtBlockStart Fix**: The user identified a bug in `isAtBlockStart()` where `if (offset !== 0) return { atStart: false }` was incorrect for cases
   like `<p> |xxx` where offset=1 but there's only whitespace before the cursor. We fixed this with a regex check `/[^ \n]/` to properly handle 
  whitespace while excluding non-breaking spaces like `&nbsp;`.

  6. **Unifying handleBackspace Logic**: The user requested unifying the `useExecCommandOnly` logic in `handleBackspace`, specifically for container 
  exits (like pressing backspace at start of `blockquote>p`). I implemented this by reusing the existing `convertBlockToParagraphWithFormatBlock` 
  method.

  7. **mergeWithPrevious execCommand Redesign**: The user asked me to rewrite the logic at line 782 using execCommand, referencing MDN documentation. 
  After reading about execCommand, I initially tried using the `delete` command to merge blocks, but the user pointed out Chrome injects styles 
  automatically. The user requested extracting clean HTML and inserting manually while fixing caret position.

  The key technical insight throughout is that `useExecCommandOnly` mode should use `outdent` + `formatBlock('p')` pattern for consistent behavior, and 
  when merging content, clean HTML extraction with manual insertion avoids Chrome's automatic styling.

  Summary:
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user wanted to integrate working execCommand logic for handling backspace operations in a markdown editor, specifically unifying the behavior 
  when the `useExecCommandOnly` flag is enabled. The core request involved implementing consistent `executeCommand('outdent')` and 
  `executeCommand('formatBlock', 'p')` patterns for various backspace scenarios, and redesigning merge logic to avoid Chrome's automatic style 
  injection.

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - execCommand API with formatBlock, outdent, delete, and insertHTML commands
     - Chrome's automatic style injection when using execCommand
     - Block-level element merging in contentEditable
     - Cursor/caret position management during DOM operations
     - Whitespace handling in text nodes (regular spaces vs &nbsp;)
     - useExecCommandOnly flag for unified command behavior
     - Clean HTML extraction to preserve formatting without browser styling

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/Users/xor/repo/vue-md/src/utils/MarkdownBlockEditor.js`
       - Primary file containing markdown block editing logic
       - **Line 229-246 `isAtBlockStart()` fix**: Corrected whitespace detection logic
         ```javascript
         // Quick check: if we're in a text node and not at the start, check if there's only whitespace before
         if (offset !== 0 && container.nodeType === Node.TEXT_NODE) {
           const textBefore = container.textContent.substring(0, offset)
           if (/[^ \n]/.test(textBefore)) return {atStart: false}
         }
         ```
       - **Line 1129-1140 Container exit logic**: Unified execCommand handling for container exits
         ```javascript
         } else if (isInContainer) {
           if (this.useExecCommandOnly) {
             this.log('Using unified conversion logic for container exit')
             const result = this.convertBlockToParagraphWithFormatBlock(blockElement)
             this.log('handleBackspace: unified conversion returned', result)
             return result
           } else {
             this.log('Calling exitContainer')
             const result = this.exitContainer(blockElement, container)
             this.log('handleBackspace: exitContainer returned', result)
             return result
           }
         ```
       - **Line 782-810 mergeWithPrevious execCommand redesign**: Clean HTML merge implementation
         ```javascript
         if (this.useExecCommandOnly && !isCrossContainerMerge) {
           this.log('Using execCommand with clean HTML merge')
           
           // Extract clean content from current block
           const cleanContent = this.extractInlineContent(blockElement)
           const cursorPosition = previousElement.textContent.length
           
           // Position cursor at end of previous element
           const range = document.createRange()
           const selection = window.getSelection()
           range.setStart(previousElement, previousElement.childNodes.length)
           range.collapse(true)
           selection.removeAllRanges()
           selection.addRange(range)
           
           // Insert clean content using execCommand
           this.executeCommand('insertHTML', cleanContent)
           
           // Remove the current block
           range.selectNode(blockElement)
           selection.removeAllRanges()
           selection.addRange(range)
           this.executeCommand('delete')
           
           // Fix cursor position to the merge boundary
           this.setCursorPosition(previousElement, cursorPosition)
           
           return true
         }
         ```

  4. Errors and fixes:
     - **isAtBlockStart whitespace handling error**: Initial `if (offset !== 0)` check was too strict and failed for cases like `<p> |xxx`. Fixed with 
  regex `/[^ \n]/` to properly detect non-whitespace content while excluding &nbsp;.
     - **User feedback on execCommand approach**: User pointed out that Chrome injects styles automatically when using execCommand delete, so I 
  redesigned to extract clean HTML and insert manually while preserving caret position.
     - **Logic reuse suggestion**: User suggested reusing existing `convertBlockToParagraphWithFormatBlock` method instead of duplicating 
  outdent+formatBlock logic.

  5. Problem Solving:
     - Unified execCommand behavior across different backspace scenarios
     - Resolved whitespace detection edge cases in block start detection
     - Implemented clean HTML merging to avoid browser styling artifacts
     - Maintained cursor position accuracy during block merging operations

  6. All user messages:
     - "I commented code in } else if (blockType === 'paragraph') { // line 1130 And wrote a demo that works instead: [demo function] integrate the 
  logic into the code path I specified if execCommand use used"
     - "you should add the logic to this.mergeWithPrevious when execCommand flag is on"
     - "the logic isn't working so I reverted. function isAtBlockStart(container, offset) { // if (offset !== 0) return { atStart: false } // this line 
  is wrong, offset = 1 isn't working for this case: <p> |xxx"
     - "I tested a case with <p>&nbsp;|xxx, this shouldn't be considered as blockStart"
     - "I think the correct is if (/[^ \n]/.test(textBefore)) {"
     - "I still want a shortcut"
     - "in handleBackspace, unify the logic of useExecCommandOnly, e.g. when press backSpace on blockquote>p start"
     - "should use executeCommand('outdent') executeCommand('formatBlock', 'p'). And can we reuse logic implemented elsewhere?"
     - "if (this.useExecCommandOnly && !isCrossContainerMerge) { // line 782 Rewrite this logic with execCommand, redesign the processing. Read doc 
  first https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand"
     - "The problem is that Chrome injects style automatically. Try to extract clean html and insert manually (remember to fix caret position)"

  7. Pending Tasks:
     - No explicit pending tasks mentioned by the user

  8. Current Work:
     The most recent work involved redesigning the mergeWithPrevious logic at line 782 to use execCommand while avoiding Chrome's automatic style 
  injection. The final implementation extracts clean HTML content, inserts it manually using `insertHTML`, removes the original block with `delete`, and
   fixes the cursor position to the merge boundary. This approach maintains native undo/redo history while preventing unwanted styling artifacts.

  9. Optional Next Step:
     The current execCommand integration appears complete based on the user's requests. The next logical step would be to test the implemented solution 
  to ensure the clean HTML merge works correctly and maintains proper cursor positioning, but no explicit testing request was made by the user..
